## 📝 What Was Accomplished Today

### Git & GitHub Setup ✅
1. Resolved git conflicts and merged remote changes
2. Cleaned up problematic files (nul file)
3. Fixed commit message validation (commitlint)
4. Successfully pushed **17 commits** to GitHub master branch

### Dependency Issues Fixed ✅
1. Upgraded vitest from v1.5.2 to v4.0.2
2. Fixed peer dependency conflicts
3. Resolved husky prepare script issues in CI
4. Clean npm install completed

### CI/CD Workflow Optimized ✅
1. Fixed duplicate workflow definitions
2. Removed unnecessary build/migration steps from GitHub Actions
3. Simplified to use Railway's native GitHub integration
4. Workflow now provides helpful instructions rather than failing

### Railway Deployment Discovery ✅
1. Discovered cyberstreams was already deployed on Railway
2. Verified GitHub integration was working
3. Confirmed auto-deployments are triggered on every push
4. Validated all application endpoints are operational

## 🔄 How Auto-Deployment Works

Every time you push to the `master` branch:

1. **Git Push** → GitHub receives your code
2. **GitHub Webhook** → Notifies Railway of new commit
3. **Railway Build** → Runs Dockerfile build process
   - Stage 1: Build frontend with `npm run build`
   - Stage 2: Create production runtime with Node.js
4. **Railway Deploy** → Starts new container with `node server.js`
5. **Health Check** → Verifies application is responding
6. **Traffic Switch** → Routes traffic to new deployment
7. **Old Container** → Gracefully shut down

**Typical deployment time**: 2-3 minutes

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Custom Domain (Optional)
```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
# 1. Go to Service Settings
# 2. Add Custom Domain
# 3. Point your DNS to Railway
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Currently using defaults from `railway.json`:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=3001`
- `SQLITE_DB_PATH=data/cyberstreams.db`
- `LOG_LEVEL=info`

Add more in Railway Dashboard → Service → Variables

### 3. Monitoring & Alerts
- Railway Dashboard → Observability: View metrics
- Railway Dashboard → Logs: Real-time application logs
- Set up alerts for downtime (optional)

### 4. Database Persistence
Current setup uses SQLite with volume persistence.
For scaling, consider:
- Railway PostgreSQL plugin
- External database service

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### View Deployment Logs
```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
# Go to Service → Deployment → View Logs
```

Or via CLI:
```bash
