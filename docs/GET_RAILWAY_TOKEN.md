**Alternative: Let me use Browser Login**

If you prefer, I can open Railway login in a browser for you:

```bash
railway login
```

Then follow the browser prompt to authorize. After that, I can deploy immediately.

Which method do you prefer?
1. Give me your API token
2. Let me use Playwright to automate browser login

Tell me which one and I'll proceed!
