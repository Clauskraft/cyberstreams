## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Cyberstreams seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to the maintainer:
- Email: [Create a private security advisory on GitHub](https://github.com/Clauskraft/cyberstreams/security/advisories/new)
- Or email the maintainer directly (contact available in profile)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- We will provide a detailed response within 7 days, including our evaluation and expected resolution timeline
- We will keep you informed about our progress toward a fix
- We will notify you when the vulnerability is fixed

### Security Best Practices

When deploying Cyberstreams, we recommend:

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets or API keys to the repository. Use environment variables or secret management systems.

2. **Database Security**: 
   - Use strong passwords for database credentials
   - Restrict database access to trusted networks
   - Enable SSL/TLS for database connections in production

3. **API Keys**:
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Use separate API keys for different environments
   - Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity

4. **Network Security**:
   - Deploy behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik, etc.)
   - Enable HTTPS/TLS for all connections
   - Configure CORS appropriately for your environment
   - Use rate limiting to prevent abuse

5. **Updates**:
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Monitor security advisories for dependencies
   - Apply security patches promptly

6. **Access Control**:
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Regularly review and audit access logs

### Public Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure:
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will not disclose the vulnerability until a fix is available
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- After the fix is released, we will publish a security advisory

### Security Features

Cyberstreams includes several security features:
- Helmet.js for security headers
- CORS protection
- Rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure session management
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- XSS protection

### Security Scanning

This repository uses automated security scanning:
- CodeQL for static code analysis
- Gitleaks for secret scanning
- Dependabot for dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular security audits via npm audit

### Bug Bounty

We currently do not have a bug bounty program, but we deeply appreciate security researchers who help us maintain a secure platform.

## Questions

If you have questions about this security policy, please open a GitHub Discussion or contact the maintainer.
