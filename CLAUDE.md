# Claude Code Integration Guide

This repository uses [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) for AI-assisted development and code review.

## ðŸ¤– Available GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Claude Code Integration (`claude.yml`)

Automatically triggers when Claude is mentioned in:
- Issue comments (`@claude`)
- Pull request review comments (`@claude`)
- Pull request reviews (`@claude`)
- Issue titles or descriptions (`@claude`)

**Usage:**
- Tag `@claude` in any comment to invoke Claude for assistance
- Claude can read CI results and help debug failed tests
- Claude will respond with suggestions, fixes, or explanations

### 2. Automated Code Review (`claude-code-review.yml`)

Automatically reviews all pull requests when opened or updated.

**Features:**
- Code quality and best practices analysis
- Potential bug detection
- Performance considerations
- Security concern identification
- Test coverage assessment

**Configuration:**
The workflow can be customized to:
- Filter by PR author
- Only run on specific file changes (TypeScript, JavaScript, etc.)
- Adjust review criteria based on project needs

## ðŸ”§ Setup Requirements

### Required GitHub Secrets

Add the following secret to your repository settings:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key for Claude access

### Permissions

The workflows require the following permissions:
- `contents: read` - Read repository content
- `pull-requests: read` - Read pull request information
- `issues: read` - Read issue information
- `id-token: write` - Write ID tokens for authentication
- `actions: read` - Read CI results (optional, for debugging)

## ðŸ“š Style and Conventions

When Claude performs code reviews or makes suggestions, it follows these guidelines:
